# nosql-challenge
This challenge asks that we use NoSQL to evaluate some of the ratings data for a magazine in order to help their journalists and food critics decide the direction of future articles.

## Structure
- **Hygiene_Ratings**
  - `.ipynb_checkpoints`
  - **Resources**:
    - `establishments.json` - contains fields necessary for reviews
  - `NoSQL_setup.ipynb` - contains download on JSON and set-up process
  - `NoSQL_analysis.ipynb` - converts some of the data to data frames for easy application
